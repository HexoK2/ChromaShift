Chroma Shift
Welcome to the **Chroma Shift** repository!

Chroma Shift is an educational and fun video game project, designed to introduce **beginners to game development** using Unity. This minimalist game aims to provide a relaxing and colorful experience, ideal for learning the basics of game creation.

## üéÆ The Game
Step into the shoes of a small character in an abstract and colorful world. Your objective? Collect specific colored objects to progress through ten unique levels. Each level introduces new challenges, various obstacles (walls, holes, moving platforms, teleporters), and increasing collection goals.

The game focuses on:

- Fluid character movement.

- Intuitive object collection.

- A gentle progression of difficulty through thematic levels.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Aspects
- Game Engine: Developed with Unity 6.

- Assets: Uses simple geometric shapes and vibrant colors, complemented by sounds and music from free libraries.

- Key Scripts: PlayerController (movement), Collectible (object collection), LevelManager (level and objective management), Obstacle (obstacle behavior). Scripts for bonuses, traps, and a timer are also planned.

## üóìÔ∏è Project Status & Planning
This project is designed as a complete learning journey, from initial conception to finalization. Development is structured over approximately two months of part-time work, including:

- Conception and asset creation.

- Implementation of core mechanics and levels.

- Addition of advanced features (bonuses, traps, timer).

- Testing and adjustment phases.

- Finalization of interfaces (menus, options, credits).

## üí° Who Is This For?
- Beginner game developers (especially with Unity).

- Anyone looking for a simple and relaxing game experience.

- Educators seeking an accessible project example.
